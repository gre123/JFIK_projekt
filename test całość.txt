DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts.Of course you can **__//''combine''//__** all these.You can use <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>, too.You can mark something as <del>deleted</del> as well.This is some text with some linebreaks\\ Note that thetwo backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line\\or followed by\\ a whitespace \\this happens without it.DokuWiki supports multiple ways of creating links. External links are recognizedautomagically: http://www.google.com or simply www.google.com - You can setlink text as well: [[http://www.google.com|This Link points to google]]. Emailaddresses like this one: <andi@splitbrain.org> are recognized, too.Internal links are created by using square brackets. You can either just givea [[pagename]] or use an additional [[pagename|link text]].You can use [[some:namespaces]] by using a colon in the pagename.You can add footnotes ((This is a footnote)) by using double parentheses.==== Headline Level 3 ======= Headline Level 4 ===== Headline Level 5 ==Real size: {{dokuwiki128.png}} External image: {{http://de3.php.net/images/php.gif}}By using four or more dashes, you can make a horizontal line:-------  * This is a list  * The second item    * You may have different levels  * Another item  - The same list but ordered  - Another item    - Just use indention for deeper levels    - Another item at this level  - That's it8-) 8-O :-( =) :-\ :-? :-D :-P :-O :-X :-| ;-) ^_^ :?: :!: - Smileys-> <- <-> => <= <=> >> << -- --- (c) (tm) (r) - Arrows and stuffI think we should do it> No we shouldn't>> Well, I say we should> Really?>> Yes!>>> Then lets do it!Dialogi bez odpowiedniego stylu css wygladaja malo ciekawie, ale znaczniki HTML sa prawidlowe.^ Heading 1	^ Heading 2	^ Heading 3	^| Row 1 Col 1	| Row 1 Col 2	| Row 1 Col 3	|| Row 2 Col 1	| some colspan (note the double pipe) ||| Row 3 Col 1	| Row 3 Col 2	| Row 3 Col 3	|<nowiki>This is some text which contains addresses like this: http://www.splitbrain.org and **formatting**, but nothing is done with it.</nowiki>The same is true for %%//__this__ text// with a smiley ;-)%%.<code>This is preformatted code all spaces are preserved: like              <-this</code><file>This is pretty much the same, but you could use it to show that you quoted a file.</file>
